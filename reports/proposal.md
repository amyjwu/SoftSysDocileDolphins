1) 
The goal of our project is to visually demonstrate the Brachistochrone curve using OpenGL. Our team is confident that we can achieve the lower bound of being able to visually demonstrate at least one cycloid example, the Brachistochrone curve, using our custom physics engine.
The Brachistochrone curve has interesting properties; most notably if you were to place a ball at the top of the curve and allow it to fall, it will reach the end of the curve faster than any other type of curve or slant. It also has the interesting property where the amount of time the ball takes to reach the bottom of the curve is a constant value independent of where the ball started on the curve (when referencing this quality the curve is sometimes referred to as a Tautochrone curve). These are the two main properties we aim to showcase.
Our stretch goal is to include how other factors like friction and angular momentum can affect the time to reach point b from point a in both the Brachistochrone curve and the Tautochrone curve. Another stretch goal could be to visually demonstrate other relevant curves stemming from cycloids and linear slopes. Another stretch goal is to visually demonstrate how cycloids and these curves pertain to real world examples such as pendulum swings, efficiency in shortest time path (the curve of fastest descent, the b curve) versus shortest distance path, or light refraction. Another stretch goal would be to work on the GUI for the project, perhaps to make it more interactive for the user. 

2) 
Our team members have acquired knowledge of cycloids and curves through online readings and videos on youtube. We specifically used the youtube channel, vsauce, to witness the demonstration of the curves using a physical product. However, when Adam Savage, one of the hosts, demonstrated the Tautochrone curve using the model, friction came into play which messes up the results. Another problem with the physical model was that the balls had to be tested on higher points on the curve. The other host mentioned that it would be better to demonstrate via computer simulation, which gave us the idea to do just that. 
We have also done some research on a working physics engine to get a better idea of what type of properties our engine will need to have to properly model the simulation. We tested the Bullet Physics engine which is much more advanced than we will likely need. We found that the three main forces we will need to account for are gravity, friction, and angular moment if we want to produce a simulation with the most realistic properties. 

3) 
For this project, the main resource we will be using is OpenGL. We want to use OpenGL to access a high quality and high performance visual simulation to demonstrate the curve. Another main resource is creating, or testing the physics engine. We can use an engine like the Bullet Physics engine. Other resources we have explored is to use Blender to make the cycloid and to export the vertex/face mapping into OpenGL. The main resources we have gathered and used for our project is listed below:

https://www.blender.org/ - We will be using Blender software to make the cycloid ramp. We selected this resource because three of our team members have used Blender prior to this project.

4) Link to view our product backlog: https://trello.com/b/my1FuYhe/softsysdociledolphins   Through in class conversation on Monday 1/30 and online conversation, our team figured out the product backlog for the next two sprints based on what we have accomplished by the end of sprint 1. 

5) The only roadblock we encountered during Monday 1/30 class is figuring out how to make the cycloid on Blender. Other than that, our team will reach out to the instructors if we have any additional questions.
