1) The goal of our project is visually demonstrate the Brachistochrone curve using OpenGL. The lower bound that our team is confident we can achieve is being able to visually demonstrate at least one cycloid example, the Brachistochrone curve, using our custom physics engine.

The Brachistochrone curve has interesting properties; most notably if you were to place a ball at the top of the curve and allow it to fall, it will reach the end of the curve faster than any other type of curve or slant. It also has the interesting property where the amount of time the ball takes to reach the bottom of the curve is a constant value independent of where the ball started on the curve (when referencing this quality the curve is sometimes referred to as a Tautochrone curve). These are the two main properties we aim to showcase.

Our stretch goal is to include how other factors like friction and angular momentum can affect the time to reach point b from point a in both the Brachistochrone curve and the Tautochrone curve. Another stretch goal could be to visually demonstrate other relevant curves stemming from cycloids and linear slopes. Another stretch goal is to visually demonstrate how cycloids and these curves pertain to real world examples such as pendulum swings, efficiency in shortest time path (the curve of fastest descent, the b curve) versus shortest distance path, or light refraction. Another stretch goal would be to work on the GUI for the project, perhaps to make it more interactive for the user. 

2) Our team members have acquired knowledge of cycloids and curves through online readings and videos on youtube. We specifically used the youtube channel, vsauce, to witness the demonstration of the curves using a physical product. However, when Adam Savage, one of the hosts, demonstrated the t curve using the model, friction came into play which messes up the results, and only allowing the balls be tested on higher points on the curve. The other host mentioned that it would be better to demonstrate via computer simulation, which gave us the idea to do just that. 

We have also done some research on a working physics engine to get a better idea of what type of properties our engine will need to have to properly model the simulation. We tested the Bullet Physics engine which is much more advanced than we will likely need, however we have found out the three main forces we will need to account for are gravity, friction and angular moment if we wanted to simulation to have the most realistic properties. 

3) For this project, the main resource we will be using is OpenGL. https://www.opengl.org/about/ We want to use OpenGL to access a high quality, high performance visual simulation to demonstrate the curve. Another main resource is creating, or testing the physics engine. We can use engines like Bullet Physics engine. Other resources might be to use Blender (https://www.blender.org/)  to make the cycloid and to export the vertex/face mapping into OpenGL.
