#Project 1 Preliminary Report

**1) State the goal of your project, ideally including a lower bound you are confident you can achieve and a stretch goal that is more ambitious.  This can be an updated version of the section you wrote in the proposal.**


The goal of our project is to visually demonstrate the Brachistochrone curve using OpenGL. Our team has been able to achieve one part of the lower bound, which is being able to visually demonstrate the Brachistochrone curve using the Blender software’s physics engine (demo: https://youtu.be/gyFq77QwwsM)  . 

The second part of the lower bound we are currently in the process of developing is making a custom physics engine to demonstrate the same curve. We have been able to demonstrate the properties of the Brachistochrone curve using the Blender software’s physics engine. We are in the process of demonstrating the Brachistochrone curve on the Blender software’s physics engine as well. Since we are still in the process of creating our custom physics engine, our lower bound is the same: to visually demonstrate at least one cycloid, the Brachistochrone curve, using our custom physics engine. Our stretch goals are still the same: to include other factors like friction and angular momentum, to visually demonstrate other curves that stem from cycloids, to visually demonstrate real world applications of cycloids/curves, and to think more in depth about an interactive GUI for the project. 


**2) Include a list of each project-related card you completed in Sprints 1 and 2. Annotate each card with a pointer to concrete evidence that the card has been completed (e.g. link to committed code, notes from a reading). If you have cards you can't provide evidence for, or work you did that doesn't have a card, make a note of it and use it to refine your cards for the next sprint.**

We used an excel sheet to keep track of our project tasks completed in Sprints 1 and 2.

**3) Show preliminary results from your code. Depending on the project this could be a short demo video, example text sequence of commands and outputs, or some other form. Looking ahead to your final report, (updated versions of) these can serve as your usage examples.**

**4) Demonstrate that you have assembled the resources you need to complete the project.  One good way to do that is to update your annotated bibliography (with a pointer to each resource and a few sentences that describe the content) from the proposal.**

working on how to annotate our resource bibliography correctly - one way is to check how Allen annotates his bibliography https://github.com/AllenDowney?tab=repositories


**5) Present a product backlog for the next sprint that represents a concrete plan that will keep the entire team productively engaged and get you to your stated goals (this can be a link to your Trello board). If you had trouble putting together evidence for your cards in the previous sprints, adjust your new cards accordingly.**

**6) Enumerate potential roadblocks and ways instructors can help.  Do you need materials? Do you have show-stopping questions you have not been able to answer?**

--Problem with collaborating on the physics engine code because it contains several pieces
